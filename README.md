# nothing-_to_prove
This is a repository with collection of few of my code to validated my knowledge on python. Moreover, it a self testing platform. If someone is reading this and find any mistake do create a issue so I can learn from my fault. Hope it is useful for people who are starting their programming carrer
This also my playground to learn and play with C#
