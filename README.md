# nothing-_to_prove
This is a repository with collection of few of my code to validated my knowledge on python. Moreover, it a self testing platform. If someone is reading this and find any mistake do create a issue so I can learn from my fault. Hope it is useful for people who are starting their programming carrer
This also my playground to learn and play with C#
When someone is interested in looking at my c# skills or tryouts you can find it in the model prac. where I have create two funny games to entertain myself one is MADLIB and second is Gender predictor. Please check it out and suggest me if I can solve it in a better fashion.

My_cricket_app: inspired from google sport page. I found they are running section in seprate loop causing a time lag to the end user while checking the score so I am trying to update it in single iteration.
